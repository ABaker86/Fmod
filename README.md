File Mod
====

Fmod is an applicaton that modifies the timestamp on documents.

Implimentation
=============

The Fmod application is created as a `Java Swing `app. The completed app will featrue a simple menue for finding a singel file, displaying its current timestamp, and then modifying it. 

Uses
====

Clearly there are few uses for this application. However, if you find yourself in and academic environment in which you fall behind on completing your assignment this application could help. Simply pass in the late assignment file, modify the date stamp to a previous data and present it to the your instructor. I will not garantee that this will work for everyone but I can say that it has worked.
